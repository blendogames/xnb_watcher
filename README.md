## About
This is a tool that converts textures/models/sound/font/etc assets into the XNB file format (for the [FNA](https://fna-xna.github.io) game framework). XNB Watcher will detect when files are added or modified in a specific folder, and will automatically convert the file to XNB format without any action required from you.
